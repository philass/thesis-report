Introduction

A programming language in the Browswer:

  - Javascript
   -- Why it was invented
   -- Its sticking power
   -- Advances
       - v8
       - asm.js
   -- fundemental language shortages
      - garbage collection
      - bad target language

  - WASM
   -- How it addresses the shortages of Javascript
       -- Low level, runs everywhere
       -- Built in support from compiler toolchains
       -- Shared support from the browser
   -- Easiest way to use it in the browser

  FUthark
    -- in the browser
    


WASM backend for Futhark
   -- Motivation
      -- Futhark is a high performance programming language. 
      -- Natural fit for WASM (ie near native speeds)
   -- Compiler choices
     -- Generate LLVM IR
     -- Plug in Emscripten -> to C (this is what I do)
   -- Implementation
     -- Massage the C
     -- Generate Usable Javascript libraries
   -- Using Node as a local test environment
   -- Need solution to run in the browser


Parralelism in the browser
  
  - Types of parrallelism locally
     - Multicore
       - Open MPI
       - Pthreads
    - GPU 
       - Cuda
       - OpenCL
  - In the browser
    Multicore
      -- Pthreads
      -- Javascript
    GPU
      -- WebGPU
      -- ShaderLangs
  Little blurb
  Multicore support logical place to start

  My implementation
    - Webworkers
    - Slight changes to Pipeline for multicore
    - Headless browswer testing
