abstract = { Futhark is a purely functional data-parallel array language that offers a machine-neutral programming model and an optimising compiler that generates OpenCL code for GPUs.  This paper presents the design and implementation of three key features of Futhark that seek a suitable middle ground with imperative approaches.  First, in order to express efficient code inside the parallel constructs, we introduce a simple type system for in-place updates that ensures referential transparency and supports equational reasoning.  Second, we furnish Futhark with parallel operators capable of expressing efficient strength-reduced code, along with their fusion rules.  Third, we present a flattening transformation aimed at enhancing the degree of parallelism that (i) builds on loop interchange and distribution but uses higher-order reasoning rather than array-dependence analysis, and (ii) still allows further locality-of-reference optimisations. Finally, an evaluation on 16 benchmarks demonstrates the impact of the language and compiler features and shows application-level performance competitive with hand-written GPU code. },
